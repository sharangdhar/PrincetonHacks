#MindReader (Hack Princeton 2014)

### About
We wanted to provide a simple interface between an EEG headset and a computer, so we decided to build a wireless fully wearable system that provides very easy to use Bluetooth serial output through an Arduino to computer applications.

A MindFlex headset was used for the NeuroSky ASIC that reads brain activity and outputs it into a simple UART serial signal. This was attached to an Arduino Uno to process the information and output an easy to read signal representing either high concentration of low concentration (relaxation). This information is communicated via Bluetooth to a PC, where it can be easily used in any application to provide input. It is demonstrated on a simple game.
